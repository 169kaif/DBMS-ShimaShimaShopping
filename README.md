# DBMS--ShimaShimaShopping
Created a shopping application involving a database as a project for the course CSE-202 (DBMS - Database Management Systems) in the 4th semester.


## What the project contains?
The project contains a project proposal, a user guide, an entity relation model diagram, a relational schema, dump files to create and populate the database, an additonal file containing queries that may be useful, a document illustrating how the transactions are scheduled, a python script that provides a command line interface.

## What was used to build the project?
The database used was MySql. The script for CLI was written in Python and used MySqlConnector to run queries and retrieve results from the same. The programming methodology employed was functional.

## How to use the project?
First setup the database and populate it using the dump files, then pop open the python script and configure MySqlConnector by providing it your username and password so that it may connect to the database and then finally run the script.
